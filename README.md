# Online Shopping Analysis for 2019

The dataset that is used in this project is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets and it has many information about customers transactions in an online shop.
In our EDA we are answering questions like:
1. How many female and male customers the shop has.
2. How many coupons are used for different discount types (10%, 20%, 30%).
3. How the average price performs for each month (max, min, mean and outliers.)
4. Which product is prefered from males/females.
