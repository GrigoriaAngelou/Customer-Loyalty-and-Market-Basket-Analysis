# Customer Loyalty and Market Basket Analysis

The dataset that is used in this project is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets and it has many information about customers transactions in an online shop.
In our EDA we are answering questions like:
1. How many female and male customers the shop has.
2. How many coupons are used for different discount types (10%, 20%, 30%).
3. How the average price performs for each month (max, min, mean and outliers.)
4. Which product is prefered from males/females.
5. How top 3 products of the shop perform for each month.

In general, we will try to derive online shopping trends and patterns for the customers that uses this platform to shop.
In addition, we created a dashboard using Tableau Public were we made a customer loyalty and a market basket analysis.
